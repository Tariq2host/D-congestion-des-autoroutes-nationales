# ETL data with Apache Airflow: Highway Traffic Data Consolidation

## Project Context
The goal of this project is to address congestion on national highways by analyzing road traffic data collected from various toll plazas. Each highway is managed by a distinct toll operator, each with its own IT infrastructure and unique data formats. The project aims to standardize and consolidate this diverse data into a single, unified file for further analysis.

## Objectives
In this project, you will:

1. **Extract Data**
   - Retrieve data from multiple file formats:
     - CSV files
     - TSV files
     - Fixed-width text files

2. **Transform Data**
   - Process and standardize the extracted data for consistency.

3. **Load Data**
   - Save the transformed data into a staging area for further use.

## Tools and Frameworks
The project leverages **Apache Airflow** to orchestrate and automate the data pipeline. The implementation includes:

- **BashOperator** for task execution.

## Deliverables
- An Airflow Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that:
  - Extracts data from the specified file formats.
  - Applies the necessary transformations to standardize the data.
  - Loads the cleaned data into a staging area.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Environment Preparation**
   - Install Apache Airflow following the [official guide](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/index.html).
   - Ensure your environment supports running Bash scripts.

2. **File Formats**
   - Place the source files (CSV, TSV, and fixed-width) in a designated input folder.

3. **Airflow DAG**
   - Write the Airflow DAG to define the extract-transform-load (ETL) process.
   - Configure the DAG to use BashOperator for task execution.

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test the DAG on sample data to ensure proper functioning.
   - Validate the consolidated output in the staging area.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate additional file formats (e.g., JSON, Parquet).
- Enhance transformation logic for complex data standardization.
- Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms for real-time updates.

This project is designed to streamline data processing and enable efficient analysis of traffic patterns across national highways, contributing to better decision-making and improved traffic management.
